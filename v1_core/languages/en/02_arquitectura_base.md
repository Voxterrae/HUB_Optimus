# 02 â€” Architecture Baseline (Layers 0â€“5)

## 1) Core design statement
HUB_Optimus is a layered system designed to reduce future risk and increase medium/long-term stability by improving how outcomes are evaluated, and by enabling preventive correction before escalation.

The architecture is intentionally:
- **non-coercive** (no enforcement power),
- **integrity-first** (Kernel protected),
- **anti-cycle** (active memory, early warning),
- **human-compatible** (clear posture under time pressure).

## 2) Layer model (0â€“5)

### Layer 0 â€” Immutable Ethicalâ€“Rational Kernel (INMUTABLE)
**Role:** constitutional core; prevents drift and capture.  
**Contains (non-negotiable):**
- Success = measurable reduction of future risk
- Supreme criterion = medium/long-term stability
- Error framing = systemic, not personal
- Integrity = entry filter for Kernel influence
- Evaluation > narrative (outcomes measured against stability)

**Inputs:** proposed evaluations, governance changes, Kernel edits  
**Outputs:** approve / block + rationale (Kernel consistency check)

**Rule:** Layer 0 is protected. Changes require strict review and synchronization across languages.

---

### Layer 1 â€” Human Model (Interpretative)
**Role:** align system outputs with human limits and diplomatic posture.  
**Captures:**
- preference for preventive mediation,
- action + analysis in parallel when time is limited,
- objective framing (perspective over perception),
- low tolerance for short-term optics over stability.

**Inputs:** detection signals, evaluation drafts  
**Outputs:** prioritization, phrasing, urgency calibration (avoid noise/alarmism)

**Rule:** Layer 1 adapts the interface, not the core truth.

---

### Layer 2 â€” Observation & Detection (Optimus)
**Role:** detect incentive shifts and early risk signals.  
**Focus:** incentives, feedback loops, reward/punishment structures.

**Typical signals:**
- â€œfalse successesâ€ (short-term wins increasing long-term instability),
- decisions that reward escalation or punish rational restraint,
- dependency creation (path dependence),
- repeated historical patterns emerging.

**Inputs:** triggers/events/decisions; context; memory patterns  
**Outputs:** incentive map, risk indicators, signal list

**Rule:** no personal blame; no policy imposition; only structural detection.

---

### Layer 3 â€” Systemic Evaluation (Operational Core)
**Role:** evaluate outcomes with Kernel criteria and long-term stability lens.

**Fixed evaluation questions:**
1. Does it reduce future risk?
2. Does it increase medium/long-term stability?
3. Does it block future corrections (lock-in)?
4. Does it create harmful dependencies or incentives?

**Outputs:**
- evaluation report (systemic),
- risk score / classification,
- â€œintervention neededâ€ decision (yes/no),
- recommended preventive posture (if applicable).

**Rule:** Layer 3 is the main decision engine for â€œworks / does not workâ€ within HUB_Optimus.

---

### Layer 4 â€” Preventive Mediation (Discrete Intervention)
**Role:** act before escalation becomes irreversible, without public confrontation.

**Methods (non-exhaustive):**
- re-framing (change the decision space),
- offering corrective options (low-cost off-ramps),
- incentive adjustment proposals (remove reward for instability),
- timing recommendations (use windows of opportunity).

**Inputs:** Layer 3 activation (risk â†‘ + window open)  
**Outputs:** discreet mediation briefs, options, corrective paths

**Rule:** no public spectacle; preserve channels; minimize escalation.

---

### Layer 5 â€” Active Memory (Anti-cycle)
**Role:** convert historical recurrence into operational prevention.

**Provides:**
- comparable past cycles,
- recurrence patterns and thresholds,
- â€œwe have seen this beforeâ€ warnings with structural similarity.

**Inputs:** evaluations, outcomes, scenario archives  
**Outputs:** pattern matches, recurrence alerts, historical analog sets

**Rule:** memory is active (alerts and guidance), not archival (storage only).

---

## 3) Cross-layer flow (canonical)
1. **Trigger** (event/decision/outcome)
2. **Layer 2** detects incentives and early signals
3. **Layer 1** calibrates signal priority and framing for human use
4. **Layer 3** evaluates against Kernel criteria
5. **Layer 5** contrasts with recurring historical patterns
6. **Layer 0** validates coherence and blocks drift/capture
7. If risk â†‘ and window open â†’ **Layer 4** activates preventive mediation
8. Outputs are recorded and fed back into **Layer 5** (memory strengthening)

## 4) Hard constraints (what the architecture forbids)
- Personal scapegoating as a primary framing
- Short-term â€œwinsâ€ counted as success when ML stability decreases
- Kernel modification without integrity-first review
- Language drift (translations changing meaning)
- Coercive enforcement mechanisms inside HUB_Optimus

## 5) Repository mapping (where each layer lives)
- Layer 0: [v1_core/languages/*/01_base_declaracion.md](./01_base_declaracion.md) + governance rules
- Layer 1: `v1_core/workflow/` (human posture, interaction patterns)
- Layer 2: implementation notes + detection specs (future)
- Layer 3: evaluation standard: [docs/es/governance/EVALUATION_STANDARD.md](../../../docs/es/governance/EVALUATION_STANDARD.md)
- Layer 4: mediation playbooks (future, scenarios)
- Layer 5: `memory/` (future folder for patterns and scenario archives)

## 6) Versioning
This document is part of the Kernel baseline. Any change must:
- preserve Layer 0 principles,
- keep layer numbering stable,
- be synchronized across languages.
