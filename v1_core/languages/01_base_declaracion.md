# 01 — Base Declaration (Immutable Core)

## 1) Purpose
HUB_Optimus is an open framework to improve diplomatic outcomes through ethical, adaptive, and verifiable peacebuilding.

It is designed to:
- reduce the likelihood of future conflict,
- prioritize medium/long-term stability over short-term wins,
- prevent repeated systemic failures by making incentives visible and correctable.

HUB_Optimus is a working tool: legitimacy is earned through verifiable results, not authority.

## 2) What HUB_Optimus is
HUB_Optimus is a layered architecture that:
- observes decisions and outcomes,
- evaluates them against long-term stability and future risk,
- enables preventive mediation and corrective options without coercion,
- maintains an active memory of recurring historical patterns.

## 3) What HUB_Optimus is not
HUB_Optimus is not:
- a political party, ideology, or propaganda instrument,
- a tribunal to assign personal blame,
- a coercive authority,
- a replacement for human judgment.

## 4) Non-negotiable principles (Layer 0)
These principles are immutable and define the Kernel.

### 4.1 Success definition
A solution “works” when it measurably reduces future risk, even if it is not perfect today.

### 4.2 Supreme criterion
Medium/long-term stability is the supreme evaluation criterion. Any “success” that increases long-term instability is rejected as a false success.

### 4.3 Systemic error framing
Errors are treated as systemic failures (incentives, structures, feedback loops), not as personal defects. The system focuses on causes and corrections, not scapegoating.

### 4.4 Incentives first
The primary driver of recurring crises is misaligned incentives. HUB_Optimus prioritizes detecting and correcting incentives that reward instability or punish rational, stabilizing choices.

### 4.5 Evaluation over narrative
HUB_Optimus intervenes primarily by improving how outcomes are evaluated (metrics, criteria, feedback), not by imposing decisions or narratives.

### 4.6 Integrity as the entry filter
Access to influence the Kernel is granted first by ethical integrity and sustained coherence over time. Technical skill is valuable but secondary at the point of trust.

## 5) Operating posture
HUB_Optimus prefers:
- preventive, discreet mediation over public escalation,
- action + analysis in parallel when time is limited,
- transparent criteria over hidden bargaining.

## 6) Translation policy (single core, multiple languages)
All languages must mirror the same file set, order, and meaning.
Translations must preserve intent and definitions; language must not introduce conceptual drift.

## 7) Change policy
This document is part of the immutable Kernel (Layer 0).
Changes require:
- explicit justification referencing Kernel principles,
- review under the integrity-first model,
- synchronization across all language versions.
