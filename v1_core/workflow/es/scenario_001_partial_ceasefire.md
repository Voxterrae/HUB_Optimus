# Scenario 001 — Partial Ceasefire Without Verification

## 0) Scenario identification
- **Scenario ID:** SCN-001
- **Domain:** geopolitical
- **Date / version:** v1.0
- **Evaluator(s):** HUB_Optimus (guided)
- **Confidentiality level:** internal

---

## 1) Trigger
Announcement of a partial ceasefire agreement between conflicting parties,
without an independent verification mechanism or enforcement structure.

---

## 2) Structural context
- Actors operate under high international pressure to demonstrate de-escalation.
- Incentives favor rapid symbolic success over durable mechanisms.
- Power asymmetry exists between signatories.
- Time pressure driven by political calendars and media cycles.
- Historical recurrence of similar agreements in comparable conflicts.

---

## 3) Incentive analysis (Layer 2)
- **Rewarded behaviors:**
  - public announcement of de-escalation,
  - short-term reputational gains,
  - postponement of hard negotiations.
- **Punished behaviors:**
  - insistence on verification mechanisms,
  - delay for technical implementation.
- **Escalation risk:**
  - covert violations with plausible deniability.
- **Signal:** false success highly probable.

**Output:**
- Incentive map indicates optics > stability.
- Early risk indicators detected.

---

## 4) Human calibration (Layer 1)
- High risk of perception bias (“peace achieved” framing).
- Emotional relief likely to reduce vigilance.
- Urgency to declare success outweighs structural caution.

**Output:**
- Priority: high
- Framing guidance: neutral, non-celebratory.

---

## 5) Systemic evaluation (Layer 3)
1. **Future risk reduction:** low
2. **Medium/long-term stability:** negative
3. **Immediate suffering reduction:** partial / temporary
4. **Incentive correction:** negative (rewards symbolic compliance)
5. **Lock-in effects:** moderate (normalizes unverifiable agreements)

**Outputs:**
- Risk classification: high
- Stability impact: negative
- Correctability window: open but closing

---

## 6) Historical pattern check (Layer 5)
- Pattern match: yes
- Comparable cases show escalation within short intervals.
- Recurrent failure mode: unverified ceasefires enabling rearmament.

**Outputs:**
- Recurrence warning level: high

---

## 7) Kernel coherence check (Layer 0)
- Violates supreme criterion (ML stability).
- Represents a **False Positive Humanitarian Outcome**.
- Fails D+A priority model.

**Decision:**
- Rejected as stabilizing solution.

**Rationale:**
Short-term relief does not justify long-term instability amplification.

---

## 8) Preventive mediation options (Layer 4)
- Reframe ceasefire as provisional technical pause.
- Introduce minimal verification pilot.
- Align incentives to reward compliance verification.
- Delay public framing until mechanisms exist.

---

## 9) Final classification
- **Outcome type:** destabilizing (masked)
- **Primary risk vector:** incentive misalignment
- **Recommended posture:** engage discreetly, intervene structurally

---

## 10) Memory integration
- Strengthen pattern: “Unverified Ceasefire Trap”
- Flag future triggers with similar optics-driven incentives.
- Update early-warning thresholds.

---

## 11) Notes
This scenario illustrates why prevention must target incentives, not narratives.
