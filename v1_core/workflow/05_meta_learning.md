# 05 — Meta-Learning Rules (Derived from Scenarios)

## Purpose
This document extracts general, reusable rules from evaluated scenarios.
These rules guide future evaluations, strengthen early detection, and reduce repetition of known failure modes.

Meta-learning does not replace scenario analysis; it constrains and accelerates it.

---

## Rule 1 — Verification beats declaration
Any agreement or decision that relies primarily on public declaration, without independent verification, is structurally unstable.

**Indicator:**
- optics-driven success
- unverifiable compliance

**Action:**
- downgrade stability classification
- activate preventive mediation

---

## Rule 2 — Incentives define outcomes
If incentives reward symbolic compliance or delay structural correction, instability is likely regardless of stated intentions.

**Indicator:**
- reputational rewards without compliance cost
- punishment of verification demands

**Action:**
- map incentives explicitly
- propose incentive realignment before approval

---

## Rule 3 — Short-term relief ≠ long-term stability
Immediate reduction of harm is insufficient if it amplifies future risk or locks in failure patterns.

**Indicator:**
- partial relief with escalation potential
- deferred structural fixes

**Action:**
- classify as False Positive Humanitarian Outcome
- record pattern for recurrence detection

---

## Rule 4 — Correctability windows must be protected
A solution is preferable if it preserves or expands future correction options.

**Indicator:**
- adaptive clauses
- reversible commitments
- phased implementation

**Action:**
- favor over rigid or final arrangements

---

## Rule 5 — Memory prevents repetition
Scenarios that structurally resemble past failures require higher scrutiny, even when surface conditions differ.

**Indicator:**
- historical pattern match
- repeated incentive misalignment

**Action:**
- elevate warning level
- require stronger justification to proceed

---

## Rule 6 — Restraint can be stabilizing
Delaying public success narratives in favor of technical sequencing reduces escalation risk.

**Indicator:**
- restrained communication
- technical-first framing

**Action:**
- mark as positive deviation
- use as reference pattern

---

## Rule 7 — Stability is the upper bound
No scenario may be approved if it degrades medium/long-term systemic stability, even when humanitarian or political pressure is high.

**Indicator:**
- stability score negative
- incentives worsening over time

**Action:**
- reject approval
- document rationale clearly

---

## Rule 8 — Kernel coherence is mandatory
Any scenario outcome that violates Layer 0 principles is invalid, regardless of apparent benefits.

**Indicator:**
- ethical drift
- narrative override of evaluation

**Action:**
- block and record

---

## Usage
These rules must:
- inform future scenario evaluations,
- update detection thresholds,
- refine preventive mediation options,
- be synchronized across languages.

They are additive and evolve through validated scenarios.
