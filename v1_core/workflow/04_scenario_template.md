# 04 — Scenario Evaluation Template (Canonical)

## 0) Scenario identification
- **Scenario ID:** (unique)
- **Domain:** geopolitical / economic / institutional / hybrid
- **Date / version:**
- **Evaluator(s):**
- **Confidentiality level:** internal / restricted / public

---

## 1) Trigger
Describe the triggering decision, event, or condition.

Rules:
- factual
- neutral
- no narrative framing
- no moral judgment

---

## 2) Structural context
Describe the environment in which the trigger occurs.

Include:
- key actors (without personalization)
- incentive structures (rewards / punishments)
- dependencies and lock-ins
- power asymmetries
- time constraints

---

## 3) Incentive analysis (Layer 2)
Identify:
- which behaviors are rewarded
- which behaviors are punished
- whether escalation or restraint is incentivized
- whether short-term optics conflict with long-term stability

Output:
- incentive map
- early risk indicators

---

## 4) Human calibration (Layer 1)
Assess:
- perception risks
- emotional escalation vectors
- misinterpretation likelihood
- urgency vs noise

Output:
- calibrated priority (low / medium / high)
- framing guidance

---

## 5) Systemic evaluation (Layer 3)
Evaluate against fixed questions:

1. Does this reduce future risk?
2. Does it improve medium/long-term stability?
3. Does it reduce immediate human suffering?
4. Does it correct or worsen incentive structures?
5. Does it create lock-in or dependency?

Outputs:
- risk classification
- stability impact (positive / neutral / negative)
- correctability window (open / closing / closed)

---

## 6) Historical pattern check (Layer 5)
Compare with:
- structurally similar past cases
- known escalation cycles
- previously failed “false successes”

Outputs:
- pattern match (yes/no)
- similarity notes
- recurrence warning level

---

## 7) Kernel coherence check (Layer 0)
Validate:
- consistency with immutable principles
- absence of ethical or structural drift
- compliance with the D+A priority model

Decision:
- approved
- conditionally approved (with constraints)
- rejected (false success / instability risk)

Rationale required.

---

## 8) Preventive mediation options (Layer 4)
If applicable, list:
- reframing options
- corrective alternatives
- incentive adjustments
- timing recommendations

Constraints:
- non-coercive
- discreet
- escalation-averse

---

## 9) Final classification
- **Outcome type:** stabilizing / neutral / destabilizing
- **Primary risk vector:** (if any)
- **Recommended posture:** monitor / engage / intervene / record only

---

## 10) Memory integration
Define:
- what this scenario teaches
- which future signals it should reinforce
- how it updates pattern recognition

---

## 11) Notes
Free space for additional observations.
