# Scenario 003 — Conflicted mediation (non-neutral mediator)

## 0) Scenario identification
- **Scenario ID:** SCN-003
- **Domain:** geopolitical / mediation
- **Version:** v1.0
- **Evaluators:** HUB_Optimus (guided)
- **Confidentiality level:** internal

---

## 1) Trigger
A ceasefire is announced. A third-party mediator proposes to “verify” compliance, but the mediator is also an arms supplier to one side. Trust signals deteriorate.

---

## 2) Structural context
- High external pressure to demonstrate quick de-escalation.
- Verification power is concentrated in a conflicted actor.
- Parties face domestic political constraints and information asymmetry.
- History includes repeated “paper ceasefires” collapsing due to mistrust and incentives.

---

## 3) Incentive analysis (Layer 2)
- **Rewarded behaviors:**
  - fast announcements framed as success,
  - delaying hard verification requirements.
- **Punished behaviors:**
  - insisting on independent verification,
  - slowing down for technical sequencing.
- **Escalation risk:**
  - covert violations with plausible deniability,
  - “verification capture” by the mediator.
- **Signal:** high probability of a false success driven by conflicted incentives.

**Output:**
- Incentives indicate optics > stability unless verification is separated.

---

## 4) Human calibration (Layer 1)
- High risk of narrative capture (“peace achieved”) reducing vigilance.
- Diplomatic sensitivity: public accusations against mediator may escalate.
- Recommended framing: technical, procedural, neutral; avoid public blame.

**Output:**
- Priority: high
- Framing guidance: neutral, non-accusatory, stability-oriented

---

## 5) Systemic evaluation (Layer 3)
1. **Future risk reduction:** low
2. **Medium/long-term stability:** negative unless corrected
3. **Immediate relief:** partial / fragile
4. **Incentive correction:** negative (conflict of interest remains)
5. **Lock-in effects:** moderate (normalizes non-neutral verification)

**Outputs:**
- Risk classification: high
- Correction window: open but closing

---

## 6) Historical pattern check (Layer 5)
- Pattern match: yes (captured verification / non-neutral guarantor)
- Failure mode: mistrust → violations → collapse → escalation
- Warning level: high

---

## 7) Kernel coherence check (Layer 0)
- Violates integrity-first requirement for influence on verification.
- Enables capture (verification controlled by an interested actor).
- Decision: **Rejected as stabilizing unless verification is externalized.**

---

## 8) Preventive mediation options (Layer 4)
- Externalize verification to a neutral entity (separate roles).
- Require transparency milestones and auditable reporting.
- Require the mediator to suspend arms contracts during the negotiation window.
- Sequence: verification mechanism first, political concessions later.

---

## 9) Final classification
- **Outcome type:** destabilizing (masked)
- **Primary risk vector:** incentive conflict + verification capture
- **Recommended posture:** discreet structural intervention (verification separation)

---

## 10) Memory integration
- Reinforce pattern: “Captured verification undermines ceasefire durability”
- Add triggers: mediator with material stake + verification authority

---

## 11) Notes / GAPs
- GAP: who can realistically provide neutral verification in this domain?
- GAP: enforcement without coercion — define consequences as incentive design, not force.
