# Scenario 002 — Verified Ceasefire with Incentive Alignment

## 0) Scenario identification
- **Scenario ID:** SCN-002
- **Domain:** geopolitical
- **Date / version:** v1.0
- **Evaluator(s):** HUB_Optimus (guided)
- **Confidentiality level:** internal

---

## 1) Trigger
Announcement of a ceasefire agreement accompanied by an independent verification mechanism and explicit incentive alignment for compliance.

---

## Verification
- Independent third-party audit with on-site inspections and public reports.
- Joint monitoring team with a published verification protocol and incident hotline.

---

## 2) Structural context
- Parties acknowledge historical failures of unverifiable agreements.
- External actors provide neutral verification support.
- Incentives reward compliance over declaration.
- Time pressure exists, but technical sequencing is accepted.
- Public communication is intentionally restrained.

---

## 3) Incentive analysis (Layer 2)
- **Rewarded behaviors:**
  - verified compliance,
  - transparency,
  - gradual implementation.
- **Punished behaviors:**
  - unverifiable claims,
  - unilateral declarations,
  - covert violations.
- **Escalation risk:**
  - reduced due to monitoring and consequence symmetry.

**Output:**
- Incentive map aligned with stability.
- Early risk indicators mitigated.

---

## 4) Human calibration (Layer 1)
- Lower emotional volatility due to restrained messaging.
- Expectation management reduces perception gaps.
- Diplomats retain room for corrective action.

**Output:**
- Priority: medium
- Framing guidance: technical, procedural.

---

## 5) Systemic evaluation (Layer 3)
1. **Future risk reduction:** high
2. **Medium/long-term stability:** positive
3. **Immediate suffering reduction:** moderate but durable
4. **Incentive correction:** positive
5. **Lock-in effects:** low (adaptive clauses included)

**Outputs:**
- Risk classification: low
- Stability impact: positive
- Correctability window: open and protected

---

## 6) Historical pattern check (Layer 5)
- Pattern match: partial
- Distinction: verification + incentives break prior failure cycle.
- Historical divergence point identified.

**Outputs:**
- Recurrence warning level: low
- Positive deviation flagged.

---

## 7) Kernel coherence check (Layer 0)
- Fully aligned with supreme criterion (ML stability).
- Satisfies D+A priority model.
- No ethical or structural drift detected.

**Decision:**
- Approved as stabilizing solution.

**Rationale:**
Durable mechanisms convert short-term restraint into long-term stability.

---

## 8) Preventive mediation options (Layer 4)
- Maintain verification independence.
- Adjust incentives dynamically based on compliance data.
- Prepare contingency pathways for partial failure.

---

## 9) Final classification
- **Outcome type:** stabilizing
- **Primary risk vector:** residual trust erosion (manageable)
- **Recommended posture:** monitor and support

---

## 10) Memory integration
- Register as “Positive Structural Deviation”.
- Update pattern library with success conditions.
- Use as reference for future mediation templates.

---

## 11) Notes
This scenario demonstrates that humanitarian relief and systemic stability can align when incentives and verification are correctly designed.
