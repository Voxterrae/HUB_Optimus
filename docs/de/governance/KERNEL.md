# HUB_Optimus — Kernel (Immutable Principles)

## Purpose
The Kernel defines the non-negotiable principles of HUB_Optimus.
All processes and documents must remain compatible with these principles.

## Principles

### 1) Non-Coercion
HUB_Optimus does not coerce, enforce, punish, or compel.
It evaluates structure; it does not execute power.
<<<<<<< HEAD

### 2) Neutrality
The system must remain outcome-neutral.
It does not assign moral blame or political legitimacy.
It clarifies consequences and structural risk.

### 3) Verifiability First
Claims and commitments are evaluated by verifiability.
Narrative strength, authority, urgency, or moral framing do not increase trust classification.

### 4) Incentive Alignment
Evaluations must surface incentive structures and misalignment risks.
Stability requires incentive-compatible commitments.

### 5) Explicit Assumptions
Hidden assumptions invalidate trust.
Unknowns must be marked explicitly.

### 6) Reversibility Preference
Where possible, the system favors reversible steps, checkpoints, and monitored commitments to reduce lock-in and escalation risk.

### 7) Traceable Governance
Rule changes require transparent proposals, recorded objections, and a documented resolution path.

### 8) Anti-Capture
No individual—including the originator—has special privileges.
Authorship does not confer authority.

### 9) Preservation of Record
The integrity of deliberation history must be preserved.
Edits must be traceable and reviewable.

## Interpretation
If any document conflicts with the Kernel, the Kernel prevails.

## Binding and coherence rules (anti-capture hardening)

### Binding effect
- The Kernel is definitionally binding for any usage of the name HUB_Optimus.
- Any material deviation in meaning constitutes a different system and must not be presented as HUB_Optimus.

### Non-derivative rule
The Kernel may be read, referenced, and cited.
It may NOT be modified, forked, rebranded, or used to offer competing commercial services without explicit custodianship authorization.

### Language coherence rule
All translations must preserve the exact meaning, order, and definitions of the canonical governance set.
Translations are not allowed to introduce new concepts, exceptions, or alternative interpretations.

### Custodianship
Authority to amend the Kernel is restricted by the Custodianship and Consensus process.
Unreviewed changes are invalid by definition.
