# Start Here — HUB_Optimus in 10 minutes

## What is HUB_Optimus?
HUB_Optimus is an open, integrity-first framework that helps evaluate diplomatic and institutional decisions using:
- systemic incentive analysis,
- a stability-first evaluation lens,
- a non-coercive prevention posture,
- and structured scenario simulation.

It does not replace diplomats.  
It improves how decisions are evaluated before escalation becomes irreversible.

---

## What problem does it solve?
Modern systems often repeat known failures because:
- incentives reward short-term optics,
- early correction mechanisms are weak,
- narratives override evaluation,
- historical patterns are ignored until it is too late.

HUB_Optimus exists to break that cycle.

## How to explore this repository (recommended path)

### If you only have 5 minutes
1) Read the main README:
- [README.md](../../README.md)

2) Read the simulator overview:
- [../../v1_core/workflow/README.md](../../v1_core/workflow/README.md)

### If you have 15-30 minutes
Read the Kernel (English reference):
1) [../../v1_core/languages/en/01_base_declaracion.md](../../v1_core/languages/en/01_base_declaracion.md)
2) [../../v1_core/languages/en/02_arquitectura_base.md](../../v1_core/languages/en/02_arquitectura_base.md)
3) [../../v1_core/languages/en/03_flujo_operativo.md](../../v1_core/languages/en/03_flujo_operativo.md)

Then try the simulator:
- [../../v1_core/workflow/04_scenario_template.md](../../v1_core/workflow/04_scenario_template.md)
- [../../v1_core/workflow/scenario_001_partial_ceasefire.md](../../v1_core/workflow/scenario_001_partial_ceasefire.md)
- [../../v1_core/workflow/scenario_002_verified_ceasefire.md](../../v1_core/workflow/scenario_002_verified_ceasefire.md)
- [../../v1_core/workflow/05_meta_learning.md](../../v1_core/workflow/05_meta_learning.md)

## Try it (fast test)
Compare these two scenarios:
- SCN-001 (unverified ceasefire) → destabilizing masked "success"
- SCN-002 (verified + incentives aligned) → stabilizing outcome

Ask:
- What incentives are rewarded?
- What is verified vs declared?
- Does the solution reduce future risk?
- Does it increase medium/long-term stability?

Start here:
- [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)

Contributions are welcome, but Kernel influence is integrity-gated.

---

## Status
This is an early but functional foundation:
- Kernel baseline is defined
- Scenario simulator is working
- Governance for contributions is in place

Next phases include:
- multilingual synchronization,
- quantitative evaluation model,
- expanded scenario library.
