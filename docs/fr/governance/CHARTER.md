# HUB_Optimus Charter

## Nature of the System
HUB_Optimus is an international, non-sovereign, non-corporate system for the
structured evaluation of diplomatic scenarios, agreements, and decisions.

It is designed to improve how decisions are evaluated before escalation
becomes irreversible.

## Mission
To provide a verifiable, incentive-aligned framework that:
- makes assumptions explicit,
- distinguishes verifiable commitments from non-verifiable claims,
- surfaces escalation and lock-in risks early,
- and preserves a neutral record of reasoning.

## What HUB_Optimus is
- A structured evaluation framework.
- A shared language for scenario definition and analysis.
- A method to reduce uncertainty and manipulation by making verification explicit.

## What HUB_Optimus is NOT
- Not a predictive oracle.
- Not a decision authority.
- Not propaganda.
- Not a tribunal assigning personal blame.
- Not a coercive enforcement tool.

## Core Governance Documents
This Charter is implemented through:
- Kernel: [KERNEL.md](KERNEL.md)
- Consensus Process: [CONSENSUS_PROCESS.md](CONSENSUS_PROCESS.md)
- Custodianship: [CUSTODIANSHIP.md](CUSTODIANSHIP.md)
- Trust Layer: [TRUST_LAYER.md](TRUST_LAYER.md)
- Evaluation Standard: [EVALUATION_STANDARD.md](EVALUATION_STANDARD.md)
- Scenario Schema: [SCENARIO_SCHEMA.md](SCENARIO_SCHEMA.md)
- Name and Identity Use: [TRADEMARKS.md](TRADEMARKS.md)
- IP Notice: [IP_NOTICE.md](IP_NOTICE.md)

## Neutrality and Non-Enforcement
HUB_Optimus does not enforce outcomes.
It improves decision quality by exposing structural risks, incentive
misalignments, and verification limits.

## Anti-Capture Principle
No individual, organization, or state may claim unilateral authority over
HUB_Optimus. Legitimacy comes from transparent process, recorded reasoning,
and consensus rules.

## Versioning and Integrity
Changes must be:
- proposed openly,
- reviewed through the consensus process,
- recorded with traceability,
- and consistent with the Kernel.

## Scope and Use
HUB_Optimus is intended for peace-oriented diplomatic analysis only.
Use is restricted by LICENSE and IP_NOTICE.
Adaptation to other domains or any commercial use requires explicit
written authorization from the custodians.
