# SCENARIO_SCHEMA (HUB_Optimus)

This document defines the formal structure of a scenario in HUB_Optimus.
Goal: ensure all simulations are comparable, auditable, and repeatable.

## Golden rule
- Keep the same fields, same order, same meaning across all languages.
- Anything not defined here is a GAP and must be marked explicitly.

## Required structure (recommended v1)

### 0) Scenario identification
- ID (e.g., SCN-003)
- Domain
- Version
- Date
- Evaluator(s)
- Confidentiality level

### 1) Trigger
Which event/decision activates the analysis.

### 2) Structural context
Baseline conditions: asymmetries, pressures, history, dependencies, correction windows.

### 3) Incentive analysis (Layer 2)
- Rewarded / punished behaviors
- Escalation risks
- Signals ("red flags")

### 4) Human calibration (Layer 1)
- Likely biases
- Political sensitivity
- Urgency vs noise
- Framing guidance

### 5) Systemic evaluation (Layer 3)
Answer explicitly:
1. Future risk reduction
2. Medium/long-term stability
3. Immediate relief (if applicable)
4. Incentive correction
5. Lock-in / correction blockage

### 6) Historical pattern (Layer 5)
- Match (yes/no/partial)
- Recurrent failure mode (if any)
- Warning level

### 7) Kernel coherence (Layer 0)
- Aligned with supreme criterion?
- Any drift/capture/coercion?
- Decision: approved / rejected / approved with conditions

### 8) Preventive mediation options (Layer 4)
Non-coercive options to improve stability and verifiability.

### 9) Final classification
- Outcome type: stabilizing / destabilizing (masked) / neutral / not evaluable
- Primary risk vector
- Recommended posture

### 10) Memory integration
Which pattern is reinforced or which "positive exception" is recorded.

### 11) Notes / GAPs
List of what is missing to evaluate better.
