# HUB_Optimus — Scenario Simulator

## Purpose
This simulator enables structured, non-coercive evaluation of diplomatic, geopolitical, economic, and institutional scenarios using the HUB_Optimus Kernel.

It is designed to:
- detect systemic risk before escalation,
- identify false successes,
- compare alternatives based on medium/long-term stability,
- support preventive mediation and corrective action.

The simulator does not predict outcomes.
It evaluates structural soundness.
