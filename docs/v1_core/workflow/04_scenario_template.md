# Scenario Template (EN)

This template is used to create scenarios that are comparable and easy to iterate on. Keep all sections and be explicit: anything you do not define becomes ambiguity during the negotiation.

---

## 0) Metadata
- **Scenario ID:** `scenario_XXX_short_name`
- **Version:** `0.1`
- **Language:** `en`
- **Last updated:** `YYYY-MM-DD`
- **Author:** `name`
- **Status:** draft / stable / under review

---

## 1) Executive summary (5–10 lines)
- What is happening?
- What is the minimum objective for this round?
- What makes this scenario "hard" or interesting?

---

## 2) Actors and roles
Define clear roles (avoid "everyone" / "the international community" without further breakdown):

- **Party A:** goals, limits, internal pressure.
- **Party B:** goals, limits, internal pressure.
- **Third party (optional):** mediator/observer/verifier.
- **Other actors (optional):** field actors, allies, public opinion, etc.

---

## 3) Context and timeline
- **Prior context (3–8 bullets):**
- **Relevant recent events (3–6 bullets):**
- **Time horizon:** hours / days / weeks (choose one)

---

## 4) Interests, positions, and constraints
For each party:
- **Interests (why they really want something)**
- **Positions (what they explicitly ask for)**
- **Internal constraints (politics, economy, security, public opinion)**
- **Red lines (non-negotiables)**
- **Flexibility zone (possible concessions)**

---

## 5) Minimum objective and success criteria
Define "minimum success" in a verifiable way:
- **Minimum success:** (1–3 sentences)
- **Expanded success (optional):**
- **Clear failure:** what outcome would be "not useful"?

---

## 6) Initial proposal (draft)
Include an initial proposal to get started:
- **Main action:** (what is done)
- **Timeline:** (when)
- **Geographic scope:** (where)
- **Exceptions:** (what is NOT covered)
- **Verification mechanism:** (who, how, with what access)
- **Non-compliance measures:** (what happens if violated)

---

## 7) Verification and compliance
This section is critical. Be specific:
- **Who verifies:** (name/role)
- **What is verified:** (observable events/actions)
- **How it is verified:** (observation, reports, sensors, access, etc.)
- **Frequency:** (every X hours/days)
- **Access and security:** (zones, permits, escorts)
- **Dispute management:** (what happens if there are conflicting versions)

---

## 8) Risks and friction points
List 5–10 realistic risks:
- foreseeable misunderstandings
- incentives to "cheat"
- deliberate ambiguity
- spoilers (sabotaging actors)
- incidents in the field

---

## 9) Recommended rounds (guide)
- **Round 1:** proposal ↔ response (partial acceptance + conditions)
- **Round 2:** adjustments (verification, sequencing, guarantees)
- **Round 3:** closure (agreement text + open points)

Final delivery:
- a brief agreement draft (8–15 lines)
- list of "open points"
- next steps (who does what and when)

---

## 10) Evaluation (post-mortem)
Score (0–3 or 0–5) and note evidence:
- **Clarity**
- **Verifiability**
- **Viability**
- **Political cost**
- **Escalation risk**

---

## 11) Meta-learning (what to learn and adjust)
- What worked?
- What failed?
- What needed to be defined?
- What would you change in the scenario for the next round?
- What new questions emerged?
