# 03 — Operational Flow (Protocol 1–8)

## 1) Purpose of the operational flow
This document defines the canonical operational sequence of HUB_Optimus.
It specifies how signals are processed, evaluated, corrected, and recorded,
ensuring consistency, repeatability, and prevention of escalation.

The flow is designed to work under:
- time pressure,
- incomplete information,
- political sensitivity,
- asymmetric power contexts.

## 2) Entry conditions (what can trigger the flow)
The operational flow may be initiated by:
- a concrete decision (policy, agreement, sanction, military move),
- an observable event with systemic impact,
- a pattern recurrence detected by Active Memory,
- a structural incentive shift (reward/punishment imbalance).

No trigger requires public visibility or formal authority.

## 3) Protocol steps (1–8)

### Step 1 — Trigger registration
The triggering element is registered neutrally.
No judgment, blame, or narrative framing is applied at this stage.

**Output:** trigger record + minimal context.

---

### Step 2 — Incentive and signal detection
Layer 2 (Observation & Detection) analyzes:
- incentive structures,
- feedback loops,
- reward and punishment alignment,
- early escalation indicators.

**Output:** signal list + incentive map.

---

### Step 3 — Human calibration
Layer 1 evaluates:
- urgency vs noise,
- potential misperception,
- diplomatic sensitivity,
- risk of overreaction or underreaction.

**Output:** calibrated priority and framing.

---

### Step 4 — Systemic evaluation
Layer 3 evaluates the situation against Kernel criteria:
1. Future risk trajectory
2. Medium/long-term stability
3. Lock-in and dependency effects
4. Correctability window

**Output:** evaluation report + risk classification.

---

### Step 5 — Historical contrast
Layer 5 compares the situation with:
- known recurring patterns,
- structurally similar past cases,
- escalation thresholds already crossed elsewhere.

**Output:** recurrence match (if any) + warning level.

---

### Step 6 — Kernel coherence check
Layer 0 verifies:
- alignment with immutable principles,
- absence of drift or capture,
- consistency across evaluation criteria.

**Output:** validation or block with rationale.

---

### Step 7 — Preventive mediation activation (conditional)
If:
- risk is increasing,
- a correction window exists,
- escalation is not yet irreversible,

then Layer 4 activates.

**Actions may include:**
- reframing options,
- corrective alternatives,
- incentive adjustment proposals,
- timing recommendations.

**Output:** discreet mediation package.

---

### Step 8 — Feedback and memory update
All outcomes are recorded.
Patterns are strengthened or updated in Active Memory.

**Output:** memory update + learning reinforcement.

---

## 4) Failure handling
If preventive mediation is not possible:
- the system records the blockage,
- identifies structural causes,
- preserves the case for future pattern detection.

No forced intervention is attempted.

## 5) Time-critical mode
When time is severely constrained:
- Steps 2–5 may run in parallel,
- Human calibration (Step 3) becomes dominant,
- Precision is sacrificed only to prevent irreversible harm.

## 6) Output types
HUB_Optimus outputs:
- evaluations,
- risk classifications,
- corrective option sets,
- pattern warnings.

It does not output:
- binding decisions,
- public mandates,
- coercive actions.

## 7) Invariants
The operational flow must always:
- preserve Layer 0 integrity,
- treat errors as systemic,
- avoid escalation by default,
- prefer prevention over reaction.

## 8) Versioning
This protocol is part of the Kernel.
Changes require architectural justification and Kernel review.
