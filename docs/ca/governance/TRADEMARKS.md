# HUB_Optimus — Name, Marks, and Identity Use

## Purpose
HUB_Optimus must remain resistant to capture, commercialization pressure, and misleading claims of authority.
This document defines how the name and identity may be used without creating a private "owner" or an institutional choke point.

## Terms
- **Name/Mark**: "HUB_Optimus", "HUB Optimus", "HUB-Optimus", and closely confusing variants.
- **Official**: material that follows the Kernel and the documented consensus process.
- **Derivative**: a fork or external implementation that reuses parts of HUB_Optimus.

## Allowed Uses (without permission)
You may use the Name/Mark to:
- refer to this repository and its documents,
- cite HUB_Optimus in academic/public-interest discussion,
- build tools that *implement* HUB_Optimus methods,
- create translations that preserve meaning.

## Prohibited Uses (without permission)
You may NOT:
- claim "official" or "certified by HUB_Optimus" status,
- imply HUB_Optimus is an authority, tribunal, or enforcement body,
- use the Name/Mark to sell services that suggest endorsement,
- present a derivative/fork as the canonical system,
- register the Name/Mark (or confusing variants) in a way that prevents open public use.

## Canonical Identity
The canonical system is defined by:
- the Kernel principles,
- the consensus process record,
- and the public repository history.

Any derivative must clearly state:
- it is a derivative,
- which version it is based on,
- and what changed.

## Anti-Capture Clause
No individual (including the originator) may use the Name/Mark to unilaterally alter the system's identity, roadmap, or consensus rules.
Public legitimacy requires traceable consensus.

## Good-Faith Enforcement
If misuse occurs, maintainers/custodians may:
- request correction of claims,
- request clearer attribution,
- request removal of misleading endorsement language.

Custodians do not grant "certification". They only protect clarity and prevent deception.

## Short Attribution (recommended)
"Built on the HUB_Optimus framework (open repository). No endorsement implied."
