# HUB_Optimus — Scenario Schema

## Purpose
This document defines the required structure for describing a scenario before evaluation.

A scenario is a **structured representation of reality**, not a narrative or argument.

## Core Rule
If information is missing, it must be explicitly marked as unknown.
Silence is not allowed.

## Required Fields

### 1. Scenario Identifier
- Unique ID or name
- Date of creation
- Version

### 2. Context Summary
- One-paragraph factual description
- No interpretation or blame

### 3. Parties
For each party:
- Identifier
- Role
- Declared objectives
- Known constraints

### 4. Timeline
- Relevant past events
- Current state
- Known upcoming milestones

### 5. Assets and Capabilities
- Material assets
- Institutional leverage
- Economic or strategic dependencies

### 6. Commitments and Claims
- Stated commitments
- Public claims
- Private signals (if disclosed)

Each must later be classified under the Trust Layer.

### 7. External Factors
- Third-party actors
- Environmental or systemic factors
- Legal or geopolitical context

### 8. Information Gaps
- Unknown facts
- Disputed data
- Unverifiable claims

## Prohibited Content
Scenario descriptions must NOT:
- argue conclusions,
- assign moral judgment,
- predict outcomes,
- frame urgency rhetorically.

## Relationship to Evaluation
The Scenario Schema feeds the Evaluation Standard.
Evaluations must reference a specific scenario version.

## Version Discipline
Changes to a scenario require:
- a new version,
- a change log,
- and preserved prior versions.
