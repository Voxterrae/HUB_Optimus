# GLOSSARY

- Canonical (v1 core): The language/version that defines normative meaning first (`v1_core/languages/es/`).
- Parity reference: Secondary language that must mirror canonical meaning (`v1_core/languages/en/`).
- Source of truth: Document that resolves conflicts; in this repo it is `docs/context/STATUS.md`.
- Kernel: The immutable principle layer that constrains design and evaluation choices.
- Kernel-adjacent: Files that materially affect kernel interpretation or governance safeguards.
- Scenario: Structured case used to test incentives, verification, and systemic stability.
- Scenario template: Reusable structure in `v1_core/workflow/04_scenario_template.md`.
- Trust Layer: Claim classification model based on verifiability strength.
- Verification: Independent, observable evidence confirming a claim or commitment.
- Declarative claim: Statement without sufficient verification backing.
- False success: Short-term positive optics that increase medium/long-term instability.
- Meta-learning: Process of extracting reusable rules from evaluated scenarios.
- Critical missing section: Required high-impact section absent from a scenario (for now: `verification`).
- Fail-fast: Immediate stop with actionable error before executing downstream simulation/evaluation.
- Integrity flag: Warning raised by the evaluator when structural risks are detected.
- Governance set: Charter, kernel, translation policy, and related operating constraints.
- Link-check: Automated markdown link validation (Lychee in CI and local runs).
- Repo hygiene: Maintenance tasks that keep structure, mirrors, and automation healthy.
- Smoke test: Minimal end-to-end test proving a core path works in CI.
- No-go zone: Explicit boundary for changes that must not be introduced.
