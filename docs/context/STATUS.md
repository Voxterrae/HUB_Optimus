### Canonical languages policy (v1)

**v1_core/** (normative spec):
- **Canonical (source of truth): es**
- **Reference translation / parity target: en** (kept close, but es wins on conflicts)

**docs/** (onboarding & navigation):
- Priority languages: **es, de, en**
- Additional languages: ca, fr, ru (structure complete; translation progressive)

**Planned switch (later, not now):**
- Once en reaches stable parity, we may declare **en as canonical** for a future version (v1.1 or v2).
