# How to read this repository â€” HUB_Optimus

This repository is structured by **intent**, not by discipline.

You do not need to read everything.
Start based on **who you are** and **what you want to do**.

---

## If you are new (first contact)

Start here:
- [docs/00_start_here.md](00_start_here.md)

Then:
- [docs/03_try_a_scenario.md](03_try_a_scenario.md)

This gives you a full picture of what HUB_Optimus does
without reading the Kernel.

---

## If you want to see how it works (practical use)

Read:
- [`docs/03_try_a_scenario.md`](03_try_a_scenario.md)
- [`../v1_core/workflow/scenario_001_partial_ceasefire.md`](../v1_core/workflow/scenario_001_partial_ceasefire.md)
- [`../v1_core/workflow/scenario_002_verified_ceasefire.md`](../v1_core/workflow/scenario_002_verified_ceasefire.md)


Focus on:
- incentives
- verification vs declaration
- long-term stability

You can stop there and still understand the system.

---

## If you want the theoretical foundation (Kernel)

Read in order:
1. [../v1_core/languages/en/01_base_declaracion.md](../v1_core/languages/en/01_base_declaracion.md)
2. [../v1_core/languages/en/02_arquitectura_base.md](../v1_core/languages/en/02_arquitectura_base.md)
3. [../v1_core/languages/en/03_flujo_operativo.md](../v1_core/languages/en/03_flujo_operativo.md)

These documents define the **immutable principles** of HUB_Optimus.
They change rarely and intentionally.

---

## If you want to contribute

Start with:
- [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)

Important:
- Kernel influence is integrity-gated
- Most contributions should be:
  - new scenarios
  - improvements to evaluation clarity
  - detection of recurring patterns

Do not start by changing principles.

---

## If you are reviewing or auditing the system

Focus on:
- ../v1_core/workflow/
- scenario classifications
- learning logic in [05_meta_learning.md](../v1_core/workflow/05_meta_learning.md)

Ask:
- are incentives visible?
- is verification explicit?
- are future risks reduced or postponed?

---

## About languages

The reference language is English:
- ../v1_core/languages/en/

Other languages mirror the same structure.
Translations must preserve meaning, not style.

---

## About legacy material

The folder:
- legacy/v0_exploratory/

Contains exploratory documents and early drafts.
They are preserved for transparency and learning,
but do not define the current system.

---

## One guiding rule

HUB_Optimus does not reward:
- authority
- rhetoric
- speed

It rewards:
- clarity
- verification
- structural stability over time
