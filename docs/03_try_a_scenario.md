# Try a Scenario — HUB_Optimus in practice

This guide shows how to use HUB_Optimus by example, without reading the full Kernel.

You will compare two scenarios that look similar on the surface but lead to very different systemic outcomes.

Estimated time: 10–15 minutes.

---

## Step 1 — Open the scenario template

Open:
- [../v1_core/workflow/04_scenario_template.md](../v1_core/workflow/04_scenario_template.md)

Just note the structure:
- Context
- Incentives
- Verification
- Systemic impact
- Classification

---

## Step 2 — Scenario 001: Partial Ceasefire (false success)

Open:
- [`../v1_core/workflow/scenario_001_partial_ceasefire.md`](../v1_core/workflow/scenario_001_partial_ceasefire.md)
Focus on:
- What is declared vs what is verified
- Which incentives are rewarded
- What risks are postponed

---

## Step 3 — Scenario 002: Verified Ceasefire (structural success)

Open:
- [../v1_core/workflow/scenario_002_verified_ceasefire.md](../v1_core/workflow/scenario_002_verified_ceasefire.md)

Focus on:
- What changed compared to Scenario 001
- What is measured instead of assumed
- How future risk is reduced

---

## Step 4 — Compare

Ask yourself:
- Which scenario reduces future conflict risk?
- Which rewards long-term stability?
- Which looks good today but fails tomorrow?

HUB_Optimus does not ask:
“Who is right?”

It asks:
“Which structure survives time?”

## Step 5 — Learning layer

Read:
- [../v1_core/workflow/05_meta_learning.md](../v1_core/workflow/05_meta_learning.md)

This explains how patterns are extracted and remembered.

---

## What you just did

You evaluated incentives, verification, and long-term stability  
without prediction or authority.

This is the core of HUB_Optimus.
