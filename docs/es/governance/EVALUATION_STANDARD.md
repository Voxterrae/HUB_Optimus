# HUB_Optimus — Evaluation Standard

## Purpose
This document defines the minimum structure required for an evaluation to be considered compatible with HUB_Optimus.

It standardizes *how* analysis is expressed, not *what* conclusions are reached.

## Core Rule
An evaluation is valid only if assumptions, risks, incentives, and verification limits are explicit.

Hidden assumptions invalidate trust.

## Required Sections

### 1. Scenario Definition
- Parties involved
- Time horizon
- Scope (what is included / excluded)

### 2. Stated Objectives
- Declared goals of each party
- Conflicting or incompatible objectives must be noted

### 3. Constraints
- Legal constraints
- Political constraints
- Material or operational constraints

### 4. Incentive Structure
- Short-term incentives
- Long-term incentives
- Misalignment risks

### 5. Trust Layer Classification
- Evidence class (A / B / C)
- Verification mechanisms
- Structural trust level

### 6. Risk Vectors
- Escalation risk
- Lock-in risk
- Reversibility risk
- Precedent risk

### 7. Failure Modes
- How the scenario could fail
- Early warning signals

### 8. Stability Assessment
- Conditions under which stability improves
- Conditions under which instability increases

### 9. Explicit Unknowns
- Known unknowns
- Areas requiring additional data

## Prohibited Content
Evaluations must NOT:
- assign moral blame,
- declare winners or losers,
- predict behavior as certainty,
- appeal to authority or urgency.

## Outcome Neutrality
HUB_Optimus evaluations do not recommend actions.
They clarify consequences and structural risk.

## Reviewability
Any evaluation must be:
- reproducible,
- challengeable section by section,
- improvable via consensus.
