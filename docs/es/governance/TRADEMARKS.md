# HUB_Optimus Name, Marks, and Identity Use

## Purpose
HUB_Optimus must remain resistant to capture, commercialization pressure, and
misleading claims of authority. This document defines how the name and identity
may be used without creating a private owner or institutional choke point.

## Terms
- Name or Mark: "HUB_Optimus", "HUB Optimus", "HUB-Optimus", and confusing variants.
- Official: material that follows the Kernel and the documented consensus process.
- Derivative: a fork or external implementation that reuses parts of HUB_Optimus.

## Allowed uses (without permission)
You may use the Name or Mark to:
- refer to this repository and its documents,
- cite HUB_Optimus in academic or public-interest discussion.

## Prohibited uses (without permission)
You may not:
- claim "official" or "certified by HUB_Optimus" status,
- imply HUB_Optimus is an authority, tribunal, or enforcement body,
- use the Name or Mark to sell products or services or to imply endorsement,
- present a derivative or fork as the canonical system,
- register the Name or Mark (or confusing variants) to block public use,
- use the Name or Mark in commercial or personal performance contexts.

## Canonical identity
The canonical system is defined by:
- the Kernel principles,
- the consensus process record,
- and the public repository history.

Any derivative must clearly state:
- it is a derivative,
- which version it is based on,
- and what changed.

## Enforcement
If misuse occurs, custodians may request correction, clearer attribution,
or removal of misleading endorsement language. Unauthorized use may trigger
legal action.

## Short attribution (recommended)
"Built on the HUB_Optimus framework. No endorsement implied."
