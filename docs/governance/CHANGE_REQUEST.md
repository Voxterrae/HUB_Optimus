# Kernel Change Request

## Summary
- Change: Replace "open framework" wording with "transparent, integrity-first"
  in the Base Declaration (Layer 0) to align with restricted-use licensing.
- Scope: v1_core/languages/en/01_base_declaracion.md
- Date: 2026-01-14

## Rationale
The project is no longer free-use. The Kernel must not imply open licensing.

## Impact
- No structural changes to Kernel principles.
- Translation alignment should be reviewed across other languages.

## Approval
Pending custodial review.
