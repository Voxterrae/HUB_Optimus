# Custodianship

Custodianship defines who can protect the immutable Kernel and how the official repository evolves without capture.

HUB_Optimus does not enforce outcomes. Custodianship only governs what is accepted into the official canonical system.

---

## 1) Purpose

- Protect the Immutable Kernel.
- Preserve integrity-first constraints.
- Prevent governance capture and narrative drift.
- Ensure traceability of changes and rationale.

---

## 2) Scope

Custodianship applies to:
- Kernel and governance documents
- Evaluation standards and schemas
- Workflow templates that define official structure

It does not govern external discussion, forks, or private experimentation (but those must not be presented as “official HUB_Optimus”).

---

## 3) Custodian responsibilities

Custodians must:
- enforce Kernel coherence (no contradictions),
- require verification / Trust Layer compliance in methodology,
- reject coercive or propaganda-oriented modifications,
- require structural justification and impact analysis for Kernel-adjacent changes,
- ensure translation policy is respected for multilingual parity.

---

## 4) Who can be a custodian

Custodians are appointed by:
- initial authors (bootstrap), then
- existing custodians via the consensus process.

Selection criteria:
- repeated coherent contributions,
- demonstrated integrity-first reasoning,
- ability to resist narrative manipulation,
- consistency across time (not popularity).

---

## 5) Decision rules

- Normal governance changes follow CONSENSUS_PROCESS.md
- Kernel changes require elevated scrutiny and explicit custodian approval
- If a proposal creates ambiguity, it must be clarified before acceptance

---

## 6) Revocation

Custodianship can be revoked if a custodian:
- violates Kernel constraints,
- attempts capture (coercion, propaganda, rebranding),
- repeatedly bypasses verification standards.

Revocation is executed via consensus among remaining custodians.

---

## 7) Transparency and logs

Every accepted governance change should be traceable to:
- a PR / issue discussion,
- the rationale,
- the affected documents,
- the risks and mitigations.
