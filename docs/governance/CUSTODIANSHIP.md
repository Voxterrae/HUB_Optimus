# HUB_Optimus — Custodianship

## Purpose
Custodianship exists to protect the Kernel and the integrity of governance.
It is not ownership, not authority over outcomes, and not a certification body.

Custodians protect:
- meaning coherence across languages,
- resistance to capture and commercialization pressure,
- traceability of governance changes,
- and the public record of deliberation.

## What Custodianship is
Custodianship is a constrained governance role that:
- safeguards the Kernel (Layer 0),
- enforces the consensus process for governance changes,
- blocks semantic drift and deceptive rebranding,
- ensures translations remain meaning-identical to the canonical set.

## What Custodianship is not
Custodianship is not:
- a tribunal or enforcement authority,
- a political mandate,
- a private ownership claim,
- a gatekeeping tool for personal preference.

## Scope of powers (strictly limited)
Custodians MAY:
- reject governance changes that violate the Kernel,
- require explicit rationale and traceability for governance edits,
- require synchronization across language mirrors,
- request removal/correction of misleading “official/endorsed” claims.

Custodians MUST NOT:
- impose political decisions,
- grant “certification” status,
- unilaterally change the Kernel,
- rewrite history without traceable process.

## Kernel change rule (high bar)
Any Kernel change requires:
1) an explicit written proposal,
2) a rationale referencing Kernel principles,
3) documented objections and responses,
4) consensus review per `CONSENSUS_PROCESS.md`,
5) custodianship approval,
6) synchronization across all language mirrors.

Unreviewed Kernel edits are invalid by definition.

## Conflict of interest and anti-capture
Custodians must disclose conflicts of interest.
Capture indicators include:
- introducing exceptions via translation,
- weakening MUST/NOT language,
- rebranding the method as a private product,
- shifting governance into marketing.

If capture indicators appear, Custodians must block the change and document why.

## Transparency and record
All custodian actions must be traceable:
- what was blocked/approved,
- why (Kernel reference),
- and what changes were required.

## Removal / rotation (minimum rule)
If a Custodian repeatedly violates the Kernel, hides conflicts, or acts deceptively,
they lose custodianship status through the same consensus process.

## Non-sovereign statement
Custodianship does not create authority over participants or institutions.
It only protects the integrity and clarity of the HUB_Optimus system definition.
