# HUB_Optimus — Consensus Process

## Purpose
This document defines how changes to HUB_Optimus documents are proposed, reviewed, and adopted.

Consensus is used to prevent unilateral capture and to preserve system legitimacy through traceable agreement.

## Definitions
- **Proposal**: a documented change request (text + rationale).
- **Objection**: a reasoned statement that a proposal violates the Kernel, reduces neutrality, weakens verifiability, or introduces capture risk.
- **Sustained objection**: an objection that remains unresolved after good-faith revision attempts.
- **Consensus**: adoption after review when no sustained objections remain.

## Process Overview

### Step 1 — Draft
A proposal is submitted with:
- a clear description of changes,
- rationale and expected impact,
- references to affected sections,
- compatibility statement with the Kernel.

### Step 2 — Review Window
A defined review window is opened (timeboxed).
Participants may:
- ask clarifying questions,
- suggest improvements,
- raise objections (must be reasoned).

### Step 3 — Objection Handling (Good Faith)
If objections are raised, the proposer must:
- address the objection directly,
- revise the proposal, or
- document why the objection is out of scope.

Objections must reference:
- Kernel principles, or
- verifiability/trust issues, or
- anti-capture/neutrality risks.

### Step 4 — Resolution
A proposal may be adopted if:
- objections were resolved through revision, or
- objections were withdrawn, or
- a clear record shows objections were answered without Kernel conflict.

If sustained objections remain, the proposal is not adopted.

### Step 5 — Ratification and Record
Adopted proposals must be:
- merged with a traceable commit,
- recorded with a short change summary,
- linked to discussion/notes where applicable.

## Special Rule: Changes to Governance Rules
Any change to:
- the Kernel,
- consensus rules,
- custodianship rules,
requires heightened scrutiny and explicit compatibility justification.

## Non-Authority Clause
Consensus does not create authority over outcomes.
It only governs the integrity of the system’s documents and processes.
