# KERNEL — Immutable Core (Constitutional Layer)

This document defines the Immutable Core (“Kernel”) of HUB_Optimus.
The Kernel is the non-negotiable constitutional layer that prevents drift, capture, and opportunistic reinterpretation.

## Binding effect
- The Kernel is **definitionally binding** for any usage of the name HUB_Optimus.
- Any material deviation in meaning constitutes a **different system** and must not be presented as HUB_Optimus.

## Non-derivative rule
The Kernel may be read, referenced, and cited.
It may NOT be modified, forked, rebranded, or used to offer competing commercial services without explicit custodianship authorization.

## Language coherence rule
All translations must preserve the exact meaning, order, and definitions of the canonical governance set.
Translations are not allowed to introduce new concepts, exceptions, or alternative interpretations.

## Custodianship
Authority to amend the Kernel is restricted by the Custodianship and Consensus process.
Unreviewed changes are invalid by definition.
