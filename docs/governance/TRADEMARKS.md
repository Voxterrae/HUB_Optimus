# HUB_Optimus Trademark and Brand Policy

## Purpose
HUB_Optimus must remain resistant to capture, commercialization pressure, and misleading claims of authority.
This policy defines how the name and identity may be used without creating a private owner or endorsement.

## Definitions
- Name/Mark: "HUB_Optimus", "HUB Optimus", "HUB-Optimus", and confusingly similar variants.
- Official: material that follows the Kernel and the documented consensus process.
- Derivative: a fork or external implementation that reuses parts of HUB_Optimus.

## Permitted uses (without permission)
You may use the Name/Mark to:
- refer to this repository and its documents,
- cite HUB_Optimus in academic or public-interest discussion,
- build tools that implement HUB_Optimus methods,
- create translations that preserve meaning,
- use "Powered by HUB_Optimus" when you follow the rules below.

## Powered by rules
If you use "Powered by HUB_Optimus":
- include a link to this repository,
- include a clear disclaimer: "No endorsement implied.",
- do not present your project as official or certified.

## Prohibited uses (without permission)
You may not:
- claim "official", "certified", or similar status,
- imply HUB_Optimus is an authority, tribunal, or enforcement body,
- use the Name/Mark in a way that suggests endorsement or sponsorship,
- present a derivative or fork as the canonical system,
- register the Name/Mark (or confusing variants) in a way that blocks public use.

## No endorsement
Use of the Name/Mark does not imply endorsement by HUB_Optimus maintainers or custodians.

## Canonical identity and attribution
The canonical system is defined by:
- the Kernel principles,
- the consensus process record,
- and the public repository history.

Any derivative must clearly state:
- it is a derivative,
- which version it is based on,
- and what changed.

## Enforcement (good faith)
If misuse occurs, maintainers or custodians may request:
- correction of claims,
- clearer attribution,
- removal of misleading endorsement language.

No one grants certification; this policy protects clarity and prevents deception.

## Recommended attribution
"Built on the HUB_Optimus framework (open repository). No endorsement implied."
