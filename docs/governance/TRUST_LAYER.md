# TRUST_LAYER — Integrity-First Access Model

HUB_Optimus protects its Kernel by an integrity-first trust model.
Technical skill is valuable, but trust to influence the Kernel is earned through sustained coherence and ethical posture.

## Trust tiers (high-level)
- **Reader:** may read and reference the system.
- **Contributor:** may propose changes to non-Kernel materials under review.
- **Custodian:** may approve governance-level changes under strict process.

## Kernel access rule
Direct modifications to Kernel documents require:
1) explicit rationale referencing Kernel principles,
2) consensus review per CONSENSUS_PROCESS,
3) custodianship approval per CUSTODIANSHIP,
4) synchronization across language mirrors.

## Anti-capture rule
Attempts to:
- introduce drift via translation,
- rebrand the method while preserving claims,
- convert governance into marketing,
are treated as capture attempts and rejected.
