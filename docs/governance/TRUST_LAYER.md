# HUB_Optimus — Trust Layer

## Purpose
The Trust Layer defines how claims, commitments, and agreements are evaluated for reliability within HUB_Optimus.

It does not assess intent, morality, or legitimacy.
It assesses **verifiability**, **traceability**, and **structural trustworthiness**.

## Core Principle
A commitment that cannot be verified should not be treated as reliable, regardless of who makes it.

Trust is not assumed.
Trust is **earned through structure**.

## Evidence Classes

### Class A — Verifiable Commitments
Characteristics:
- Observable actions or states
- Independent verification possible
- Clear success/failure conditions
- Time-bounded checkpoints

Examples:
- Ratified agreements with inspection mechanisms
- Publicly auditable actions
- Reversible steps with monitoring

Status: **High trust**

---

### Class B — Partially Verifiable Commitments
Characteristics:
- Some observable components
- Limited verification scope
- Ambiguous enforcement

Examples:
- Political commitments with reporting but no enforcement
- Conditional actions without penalties

Status: **Conditional trust**

---

### Class C — Non-Verifiable Assertions
Characteristics:
- No external verification
- Dependent on intent or goodwill
- No measurable checkpoints

Examples:
- Verbal assurances
- Statements of future intent without mechanisms

Status: **Low trust**

---

## Structural Trust Score
Evaluations may assign a qualitative trust level based on:
- evidence class,
- incentive alignment,
- reversibility,
- historical precedent.

This score does not predict outcomes.
It highlights **structural risk**.

## Anti-Manipulation Rule
Narrative strength, moral framing, urgency, or authority do not increase trust classification.

Only structure does.

## Dispute Handling
Disagreement over classification must be resolved by:
- pointing to missing verification,
- proposing concrete mechanisms,
- or downgrading trust assumptions.

## Relationship to Consensus
The Trust Layer informs evaluations.
It does not override the Kernel or the consensus process.

## Non-Enforcement Clause
HUB_Optimus does not enforce trust.
It makes trust **explicit and inspectable**.
