# Start Here - HUB_Optimus in 10 minutes

## What is HUB_Optimus?
HUB_Optimus is a restricted-use, integrity-first framework that helps evaluate
diplomatic and institutional decisions using:
- systemic incentive analysis,
- a stability-first evaluation lens,
- a non-coercive prevention posture,
- and structured scenario simulation.

It does not replace diplomats.
It improves how decisions are evaluated before escalation becomes irreversible.

Usage is restricted by LICENSE (repo root) and [IP Notice](governance/IP_NOTICE.md).

## What problem does it solve?
Modern systems often repeat known failures because:
- incentives reward short-term optics,
- early correction mechanisms are weak,
- narratives override evaluation,
- historical patterns are ignored until it is too late.

HUB_Optimus exists to break that cycle.

## How to explore this repository (recommended path)

### If you only have 5 minutes
1) Read the main README:
- [Home](index.md)

2) Read the simulator overview:
- [v1_core/workflow/README.md](v1_core/workflow/README.md)

### If you have 15-30 minutes
Read the Kernel (English reference):
1) [v1_core/languages/en/01_base_declaracion.md](v1_core/languages/en/01_base_declaracion.md)
2) [v1_core/languages/en/02_arquitectura_base.md](v1_core/languages/en/02_arquitectura_base.md)
3) [v1_core/languages/en/03_flujo_operativo.md](v1_core/languages/en/03_flujo_operativo.md)

Then try the simulator:
- [v1_core/workflow/04_scenario_template.md](v1_core/workflow/04_scenario_template.md)
- [v1_core/workflow/scenario_001_partial_ceasefire.md](v1_core/workflow/scenario_001_partial_ceasefire.md)
- [v1_core/workflow/scenario_002_verified_ceasefire.md](v1_core/workflow/scenario_002_verified_ceasefire.md)
- [v1_core/workflow/05_meta_learning.md](v1_core/workflow/05_meta_learning.md)

## Try it (fast test)
Compare these two scenarios:
- SCN-001 (unverified ceasefire) - destabilizing masked success
- SCN-002 (verified + incentives aligned) - stabilizing outcome

Ask:
- What incentives are rewarded?
- What is verified vs declared?
