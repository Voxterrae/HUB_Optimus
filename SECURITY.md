# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

HUB_Optimus is documentation-first. Security fixes are applied only to the current `main` branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public issue for security-sensitive reports.

Preferred:
1. Use **GitHub Security Advisories** (Security tab -> "Report a vulnerability") if available.

Alternative (if advisories are not available):
- Email the maintainers at: <voxterraeoptimus@proton.me

What to include:
- A clear description of the issue and impact
- Reproduction steps or proof-of-concept (safe, minimal)
- Any relevant logs/screenshots (redact sensitive data)
- Your suggested mitigation, if you have one

We aim to acknowledge reports quickly and coordinate a responsible disclosure.
