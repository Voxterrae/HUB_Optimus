## What it is
**HUB_Optimus** is an open framework designed to improve diplomatic outcomes through:
- structured evaluation (incentives, verification, sequencing),
- preventive, non-coercive mediation options,
- iterative meta-learning from both failures and successes.

It helps humans and institutions:
- avoid repeating known historical failure patterns,
- detect “false successes” before they escalate,
- align incentives with medium/long-term stability,
- operate rationally under time pressure and political noise.

## What it is not
- Not an authority.
- Not a prediction engine.
- Not a replacement for diplomacy.

It is a tool for **better judgment**.

## Why this project exists
Modern diplomatic and institutional systems often fail not because of lack of intelligence, but because of:
- misaligned incentives,
- short-term optics overriding long-term stability,
- absence of early correction mechanisms,
- ignored historical recurrence.

HUB_Optimus exists to **break that cycle** by evaluating scenarios **before** decisions become irreversible.

---

## Core principles (high-level)
- **Stability over optics**  
  Medium/long-term systemic stability is the supreme criterion.

- **Integrity first**  
  Influence over the core is earned through ethical coherence, not position or credentials.

- **Evaluation over narrative**  
  Outcomes are assessed structurally (incentives, verification, sequencing), not rhetorically.

- **Prevention over reaction**  
  Early, discreet mediation is preferred to public escalation.

- **No scapegoating**  
  Errors are treated as systemic, not personal.

## Repository map
- `docs/` → onboarding and reading paths (recommended entry point)
- `v1_core/` → active kernel: architecture, operational flow, workflow, templates, scenarios, meta-learning
- `legacy/` → historical/exploratory materials (v0), preserved for transparency

> English is the reference language for structural validation. Spanish documentation is maintained in parallel for accessibility.

---

## The simulator
The scenario simulator:
- evaluates decisions and events,
- classifies risk and stability,
- detects false positives,
- proposes non-coercive corrective options,
- learns from failures and successes.

It **does not predict outcomes**. It evaluates **structural soundness**.
