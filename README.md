# HUB_Optimus

**HUB_Optimus** is an open, integrity-first framework for improving diplomatic outcomes through structured evaluation, preventive mediation, and systemic learning.

It is designed to help humans and institutions:
- avoid repeating known historical errors,
- detect false successes before they escalate,
- align incentives with medium/long-term stability,
- operate rationally under time pressure and political noise.

HUB_Optimus is not an authority.
It is a tool for better judgment.

If this is your first time exploring HUB_Optimus, begin with:
- [`docs/00_start_here.md`](docs/00_start_here.md)

It provides a guided, human-readable entrypoint before diving into the Kernel or the scenario simulator.

## Why this project exists

Modern diplomatic and institutional systems often fail not because of lack of intelligence, but because of:
- misaligned incentives,
- short-term optics overriding long-term stability,
- absence of early correction mechanisms,
- repeated historical patterns being ignored.

HUB_Optimus exists to **break that cycle**.

It provides a structured way to evaluate decisions and scenarios **before** they become irreversible.

## Core principles (high-level)

- **Stability over optics**  
  Medium/long-term systemic stability is the supreme criterion.

- **No scapegoating**  
  Errors are treated as systemic, not personal.

- **Integrity first**  
  Influence over the core is earned through ethical coherence, not position or credentials.

- **Evaluation over narrative**  
  Outcomes are measured structurally, not rhetorically.

- **Prevention over reaction**  
  Early, discreet mediation is preferred to public escalation.

## Repository structure

This repository is organized into two main parts:

### `legacy/`
Historical and exploratory materials (v0).  
Preserved for context and transparency.

### `v1_core/`
The active Kernel of HUB_Optimus.

It contains:
- the immutable base declaration,
- the system architecture,
- the operational flow,
- the scenario simulator,
- meta-learning rules.

English is the reference language for structure and validation.

## The simulator

HUB_Optimus includes a scenario simulator that:
- evaluates decisions and events,
- classifies risk and stability,
- detects false positives,
- proposes non-coercive corrective options,
- learns from both failures and successes.

The simulator **does not predict outcomes**.
It evaluates structural soundness.

See the simulator documentation:
