## What it is
HUB_Optimus is a restricted-use framework designed to improve diplomatic outcomes
through:
- structured evaluation (incentives, verification, sequencing),
- preventive, non-coercive mediation options,
- iterative meta-learning from both failures and successes.

It helps humans and institutions:
- avoid repeating known historical failure patterns,
- detect false successes before they escalate,
- align incentives with medium and long-term stability,
- operate rationally under time pressure and political noise.

## What it is not
- Not an authority.
- Not a prediction engine.
- Not a replacement for diplomacy.

It is a tool for better judgment.
