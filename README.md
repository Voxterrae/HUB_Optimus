# HUB_Optimus

This repository is organized in two phases:

- **legacy/v0_exploratory/**: historical exploratory documents (kept for traceability; not re-written).
- **v1_core/**: structured architecture baseline (the current canonical system design).

## Where to start
- Architecture (v1): `v1_core/architecture/`
- Workflow (v1): `v1_core/workflow/`
- Governance (v1): `v1_core/governance/`
- Languages (v1): `v1_core/languages/`

> Single core — multiple languages. Translations must preserve meaning and structure.
